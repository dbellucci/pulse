Pulse is a small framework for building network prober and collect response time. Right now there 
are two available prober: ICMP and HTTP but more are coming soon and little effort is required
to build new one from scratch.


Example HTTP Prober:

HTTP.probe('http://www.google.it/', :count =>5, :round_trip => 0.05, :frequency => 3, :delta => 0.0005) do |probe|
	probe.each do |rtt|
		puts "#{Time.now.to_s} rtt:  #{rtt.to_s}"
	end
end

count         total number of probe composing continuous probe set
round_trip    waiting seconds between each probe in a continuous probe set
frequency     waiting seconds between continuous probes set scheduling
delta         ignore rtt value if differs by 'delta' seconds from previous one
